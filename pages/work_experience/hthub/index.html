            After successfully completing a given challenge, I secured an interview and was hired for a backend development role. To my surprise, I was assigned the role of a React developer üò≤. The team already had a backend developer (Java boss). Despite the initial challenge, my aptitude for rapid learning, coupled with my prior experience with React, allowed me to adapt and thrive in the unexpected role. Although the beginning was a bit demanding, I successfully navigated through the challenges. Grateful for the opportunity and glory be to God üôè.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">I was assigned the following tasks: üëá</h3><br><br>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b class="main_color">The web splash screen</b></p><br>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Challenge:</b> slide animation for three different contents (images and texts).</p>
                        <p><b>Solution:</b> I implemented it with the aid of useState hook in react.</p>
                    </li><br>

                    <li>
                        <p><b>Challenge:</b> responsiveness</p>
                        <p><b>Solution:</b> made the splash screen unseen to devices with lesser screen sizes, in tailwindcss</p>
                    </li><br>
                </ol>
            </li><br>

            <li>
                <p><b class="main_color">Login and Sign up pages</b></p><br>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Challenge:</b> Pixel to Pixel designing .</p>
                        <p><b>Solution:</b> took time though, I was able to tailor the code according to the figma design.</p>
                    </li><br>

                    <li>
                        <p><b>Challenge:</b> Multi-step form (sign up)</p>
                        <p><b>Solution:</b> Ensuring no step can be bypassed without completing the required details, I utilized the `useState` hook to keep track of the current form page. Additionally, I took measures to preserve the entered information throughout the entire form-filling process.</p>
                    </li><br>
                </ol>
            </li><br>

            <li>
                <p><b class="main_color">Home, FAQ, Help center - Landing page</b></p><br>

                    <li>
                        <p><b>Challenge:</b> I encountered challenges in achieving responsiveness and precise pixel-to-pixel design alignment in this context.</p>
                        <p><b>Solution:</b> While it was time-consuming, I occasionally had to craft custom Tailwind CSS classes to address challenges related to flexible media screens and more ü•∫.</p>
                    </li><br>
                </ol>
            </li><br>

            <li>
                <p><b class="main_color">Admin Page:</b> I ensured protection against access by unauthorized users (unlogged users) and integrated keycloakify for authentication</p><br>
            </li><br>
        </ol>

        <p>
            During my six-month tenure at the startup, I achieved several milestones. As my internship concluded, I made the decision not to extend it. My focus, as a backend developer, is to delve deeper into backend development, exploring both its advantages and challenges. While I may still engage in web development with React.js, my primary emphasis is on enhancing my expertise in backend technologies. Thank you for taking the time to read üôè.
