      <p>
        I initially joined this start-up as an intern, only to discover that I
        was assigned the role of a senior backend developer 🥲, as there was no
        one else in that position on the team—just me and another intern.
        Stepping into this unexpected role has been quite demanding.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        The beginning was challenging; without a lead for the backend team, our
        plans seemed to go nowhere. We repeatedly drafted and redrafted, planned
        and replanned.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        While my colleague concentrated on setting up and constructing routes,
        my responsibility revolved around meticulous checks on route
        functionality, considering various scenarios. Surprisingly, I discovered
        that the request bodies were not being adequately verified 😯. This
        posed a potential risk for SQL injection. I wrote validation
        middlewares. Concerned, I pondered, 'What if the email doesn't exist?
        How should we validate it?' Engaging my colleague in this thought
        process led to a solution: sending verification links to users' email
        addresses during the registration process. To ensure its effectiveness,
        I dedicated an entire night to attempting registrations with
        non-existing email addresses for confirmation.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        I assumed this responsibility because I dislike lags in projects I'm
        involved in. While I may not be the most proficient, I strive to
        minimize shortcomings, understanding that no system is entirely
        flawless, but it should have minimal flaws. The process was demanding,
        involving code refactoring, thorough testing with Postman, and
        prioritizing security enhancements.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        As we progressed, my focus shifted to contemplating the models and their
        connections. I began pondering the long-term effects. Proposing frequent
        nighttime collaboration with my colleague, I introduced DrawSQL to draft
        and interconnect the models, ensuring both security and ease of access
        for the rightful owner.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        I delved into comprehensive documentation using Postman, carefully
        testing each route and configuring the API for deployments. My journey
        doesn't stop here; I'm eager to explore logging, raw testing,
        dockerization, monitoring, raw deployment, and more. I'm open to sharing
        my experiences along the way.

            <b class="main_color">API workflows</b> - I established workflows to
            visualize our processes, covering authorization, validation,
            specific queries, error handling, and more. This proved immensely
            beneficial, reducing cognitive load when writing actual code since
            the thinking part was addressed. Having a roadmap for building each
            route streamlined the process, benefiting both me and my colleague.
            Code reviews became straightforward as we had predefined processes
            to follow. Night meetings were crucial, allowing us to anticipate
            and address all possible scenarios, especially considering the
            sensitive nature of dealing with school data.

            <b class="main_color">Error Handling</b> - Upon reviewing the error
            handling middleware crafted by my colleague, I sought ways to
            fortify security and safeguard against application disruptions.
            Conducting a thorough examination of the implemented routes.
          </p><br>
          
          <div class="grid2">
            <p>
           I identified an opportunity to enhance resilience by incorporating
            try-catch methods, thus minimizing the risk of breakdowns during
            unforeseen scenarios.

          <p>
            Additionally, I prioritized the implementation
            of robust logging mechanisms and continuous monitoring to expedite
            the detection of potential lags within the application. It is
            crucial to acknowledge that these measures primarily address the
            backend, and our commitment to excellence remains steadfast. I
            remain open to exploring advanced error-handling techniques beyond
            our existing expertise.

              will help mitigate common web vulnerabilities and provide an
              additional layer of defense against potential threats.

        <li>
          <p>
            <b class="main_color">Authentication</b> - My colleague was responsible for managing JWT
            authentication, initially opting for the conventional method of
            storing it as a cookie. However, concerns arose regarding the
            security implications of this approach, whether the token was
            encoded or not, especially when dealing with sensitive information.
            Recognizing the potential risks associated with storing crucial data
            in cookies, I deliberated on a more secure strategy. Acknowledging
            the multitude of potential damages, ranging from XSS attacks to
            man-in-the-middle attacks, I sought to balance information
            persistence with enhanced security measures.
          </p>

          <div class="grid2">
            <p>
              As a result, I chose to
            implement the signed and httpOnly properties for the cookie. By
            doing so, I ensured that access to the cookie is restricted
            exclusively to HTTP requests, providing a robust defense against
            alterations by client-side scripts. The inclusion of a signature
            introduces an additional layer of security, enabling the server to
            verify the cookie's integrity upon its return and mitigating the
            risk of tampering during transit.

        <li>
          <p>
            <b class="main_color">Rate limiting</b> - My unending thirst for security led me to rate limiting. I implemented it to control the rate at which requests are made to the API per IP address, within a specific timeframe. I did this to prevent abuse, protect resources, and ensure fair usage of the application, protecting the server from overload and improving overall service reliability.
          </p><br>

          <div class="grid2">
            <p>
              Another reason I implemented rate limiting is to prevent brute-force attacks on user accounts. By limiting the number of login attempts within a specific timeframe, the system can thwart unauthorized attempts to gain access.

        <li>
          <p>
            <b class="main_color">NotFound Router</b> - Anticipating instances where unfamiliar routes might be attempted to be accessed from the API, I considered potential risks of production breakdowns 🥲. Ensuring the resilience of this API in a production environment is paramount. To mitigate potential issues, I crafted a route to handle requests to non-existent routes or endpoints. This serves as a proactive fallback mechanism, managing situations where the requested resource is not found, thus contributing to the overall stability of the API in a production setting.

          <p>
            <b class="main_color">Testing and documentation with Postman</b> - How could I be certain that the code I penned, along with that of my colleague, didn't exhibit signs of mediocrity? It's not about claiming perfection or superiority, but rather emphasizing the importance of crafting functional code. Even though I acknowledge there's always room for improvement, I actively anticipate refactoring certain sections. To validate the reliability of the codebase, I carefully tested each route using Postman, ensuring flawless operation and error-free functionality. Once functionality was confirmed, I documented each route, providing thorough descriptions for safe and efficient utilization. The resulting documentation is tailored to ease API consumption for front-end developers, offering clear guidance for both effective and secure implementation.
