        I initially joined this start-up as an intern, only to discover that I was assigned the role of a senior backend developer 🥲, as there was no one else in that position on the team—just me and another intern. Stepping into this unexpected role has been quite demanding.
The beginning was challenging; without a lead for the backend team, our plans seemed to go nowhere. We repeatedly drafted and redrafted, planned and replanned.
I was forced to lead the team, and below are the things and contributions I have made so far:

              <b class="main_color">Database diagrams</b> - I drew database
              diagrams to get a view of the database structure, how the models
              are connected to each other and the school, providing a clear
              reference for developers that will join in the future, and
              facilitate better database management.

            <b class="main_color">API workflows</b> - I established workflows to
            visualize our processes, covering authorization, validation,
            specific queries, error handling, and more. This proved immensely
            beneficial, reducing cognitive load when writing actual code since
            the thinking part was addressed. Having a roadmap for building each
            route streamlined the process, benefiting both me and my colleague.
            Code reviews became straightforward as we had predefined processes
            to follow. Night meetings were crucial, allowing us to anticipate
            and address all possible scenarios, especially considering the
            sensitive nature of dealing with school data.

                Meticulous observation and thoughtful planning were essential in

            <b class="main_color">Error Handling</b> - Upon reviewing the error
            handling middleware crafted by my colleague, I sought ways to
            fortify security and safeguard against application disruptions.
            Conducting a thorough examination of the implemented routes.

          <div class="grid2">
            <p>
           I identified an opportunity to enhance resilience by incorporating
            try-catch methods, thus minimizing the risk of breakdowns during
            unforeseen scenarios.

            Additionally, I prioritized the implementation
            of robust logging mechanisms and continuous monitoring to expedite
            the detection of potential lags within the application. It is
            crucial to acknowledge that these measures primarily address the
            backend, and our commitment to excellence remains steadfast. I
            remain open to exploring advanced error-handling techniques beyond
            our existing expertise.

          <div class="grid2">
            <p>
                I also added the Helmet library for
              enhancing the security of the application. I am very sure that it
              will help mitigate common web vulnerabilities and provide an
              additional layer of defense against potential threats.

        <li>
          <p>
            <b class="main_color">Authentication</b> - My colleague was responsible for managing JWT
            authentication, initially opting for the conventional method of
            storing it as a cookie. However, concerns arose regarding the
            security implications of this approach, whether the token was
            encoded or not, especially when dealing with sensitive information.
            Recognizing the potential risks associated with storing crucial data
            in cookies, I deliberated on a more secure strategy. Acknowledging
            the multitude of potential damages, ranging from XSS attacks to
            man-in-the-middle attacks, I sought to balance information
            persistence with enhanced security measures.
          </p>

          <div class="grid2">
            <p>
              As a result, I chose to
            implement the signed and httpOnly properties for the cookie. By
            doing so, I ensured that access to the cookie is restricted
            exclusively to HTTP requests, providing a robust defense against
            alterations by client-side scripts. The inclusion of a signature
            introduces an additional layer of security, enabling the server to
            verify the cookie's integrity upon its return and mitigating the
            risk of tampering during transit.

        <li>
          <p>
            <b class="main_color">Rate limiting</b> - My unending thirst for security led me to rate limiting. I implemented it to control the rate at which requests are made to the API per IP address, within a specific timeframe. I did this to prevent abuse, protect resources, and ensure fair usage of the application, protecting the server from overload and improving overall service reliability.
          </p><br>

          <div class="grid2">
            <p>
              Another reason I implemented rate limiting is to prevent brute-force attacks on user accounts. By limiting the number of login attempts within a specific timeframe, the system can thwart unauthorized attempts to gain access.

            While knowing that achieving 100% security is unattainable, my foremost commitment is to diligently implement measures that enhance the safety and security of the application for the users.

            <b class="main_color">Testing and documentation with Postman</b> - How could I be certain that the code I penned, along with that of my colleague, didn't exhibit signs of mediocrity? It's not about claiming perfection or superiority, but rather emphasizing the importance of crafting functional code. Even though I acknowledge there's always room for improvement, I actively anticipate refactoring certain sections. To validate the reliability of the codebase, I carefully tested each route using Postman, ensuring flawless operation and error-free functionality. Once functionality was confirmed, I documented each route, providing thorough descriptions for safe and efficient utilization. The resulting documentation is tailored to ease API consumption for front-end developers, offering clear guidance for both effective and secure implementation.
