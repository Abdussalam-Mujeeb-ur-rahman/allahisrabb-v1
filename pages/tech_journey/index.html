                This marked the initiation of my tech journey, with anxiety
                waking me in the midnight, eagerly anticipating the link to the
                altschoolafrica entrance examination. With trembling hands,
                teary eyes, and a heart beating tirelessly and forcefully, I
                took a deep breath. Swallowing my spit, I uttered fervent
                prayers before finally getting onboard. In one way or another,
                prayers were answered, and a decisive message determined my
                future path ‚Äì a pass mark.

                when I was eager to enter the tech field. Thanks to my
                persistent requests, my wonderful elder sister connected me with
                him, and he recommended

              <p>
                Fast forward to when I officially became a student of
                <a href="https://altschoolafrica.com" target="_blank"

              <p>
                My journey at AltSchoolAfrica began after I had already gained
                some foundational knowledge in HTML and CSS. This learning
                process started in 2021, thanks to the assistance of Mimo - an
                educational app designed to guide learners through various areas
                of coding, including frontend and backend development, and
                Python programming. As a result, the initial set of tutorials at
                AltSchoolAfrica felt relatively straightforward for me.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                Over time, balancing my studies and my commitment to
                AltSchoolAfrica became increasingly challenging. Attempting to
                manage both simultaneously was far from effortless. My academic
                responsibilities frequently interfered with my learning journey
                at AltSchoolAfrica. The constant requirement to stay connected
                to the internet, the inconsistent power supply, and the
                persistent misconceptions from my father all contributed to the
                inevitable disruptions. However, I remained determined and
                focused on my goals, despite the sacrifices involved.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                The ambiance of the entrance examination lingered into the first
                semester exams. Who desires to fail? üòÇ But this time, I
                approached it with a bit more calmness. To be honest, it was a
                breeze.

                During holidays, I delved into additional learning pursuits,
                encompassing JQuery, React, a Decision-Making course, Bootstrap,
                Sass, and more.

                not only equipped me with tech skills but also provided training
                on learning diverse technologies, for which I'm truly grateful.
                Among the projects I undertook was a full-stack blog app
                utilizing Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, and EJS (although
                regrettably, I lost the app due to my limited proficiency in Git
                ü•≤).
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                Without delay, I acquired a wealth of knowledge from

                  >altschoolafrica</a

                completed numerous projects, and my graduation took place in
                June 2023.

                Gratitude goes to the Almighty God, my mother for understanding
                me, my elder sister for introducing @staa99 to me, @staa99 for
                recommending altschoolafrica, altschoolafrica for providing

                I dedicated myself to prioritizing tech over personal endeavors
                ü•≤, and thankfully, it proved to be a rewarding decision with
                the Almighty's grace. Investing my hard-earned money, I enrolled
                in two other local bootcamps, Cove IT, and Techmania Web Dev.
                These endeavors coincided with my time at Altschoolafrica,
                during our holiday period. My motive was to broaden
                opportunities for myself. During this time, I developed for
                tests and examinations. I absorbed valuable insights from the
                local bootcamps and even took on a teaching role among my
                colleagues, leveraging my Altschoolafrica knowledge. Despite the
                workload, these bootcamps weren't overly challenging, as I
                managed to breeze through evaluations with ease.

                As the year came to a close and a new one approached, I embarked
                on an internship application spree. Despite facing numerous
                rejections and even no responses from several applications üòï, I
                persevered. Balancing this effort with my studies at

                a particular company; unfortunately, they did not provide any

                Flutterwave, and I decided to give it a try üòÅ. Surprisingly

                Suddenly üí•, a message appeared in my Gmail, forwarded to my
                email address. It was an interview invitation. Excitedly, I
                shared this achievement with @staa99, who advised me to prepare
                well and ensure I express my thoughts while posing relevant
                questions during the interview.

                I secured the internship position for six months, and to my
                initial surprise (which later turned into a fantastic
                opportunity), I was assigned the role of a React developer üò≤.
                The team already had a backend developer (Java boss). While I
                had some prior exposure to React during an Altschool Africa
